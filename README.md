# LRC Tutoring

Senior project for the ECE department at Cal Poly Pomona.

Live preview at: https://lrc.sammyholt.com

The goal of this project was to have a tutoring system which allowed users to set up an account, create a profile, and schedule tutoring sessions with tutors.

Tutors can create accounts and create a public profile listing.  Other users can then schedule sessions with that tutor directly from their profile page.
